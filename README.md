# Unscramble
The first time I wrote an improvement on Google code. This Android tutorial was very useful but it contains a bit of code that call a 'while' loop before it determines if the input is valid; that's bad. I packed the 'while' loop into the else-condition so it never executes on invalid input.

There's no gradle files included with this repo; consider building your own or following the Google tutorial.
